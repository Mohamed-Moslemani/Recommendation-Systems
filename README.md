## 🌠 Project Overview

This repository explores various recommendation techniques, leveraging the power of Spark for handling large datasets and providing fast, scalable recommendations. We’re working with datasets to create personalized movie and animation recommendations, using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.

## 🔍 Key Components

| File/Folder                 | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `animation_recommendation/` | Contains scripts and models specific to recommending animations.            |
| `movie_recommendation/`     | Contains scripts and notebooks for building a movie recommendation system.  |
| `.gitignore`                | Specifies files to ignore in the repository.                                |
| `requirements.txt`          | Lists dependencies needed for the project, including Spark and ML libraries.|

## 📄 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on user-item interactions and similarity between users or items.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on attributes and content similarity.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches to improve recommendation quality.
- **Scalable Data Processing with Spark**: Efficiently handles large datasets to provide fast recommendations.

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mohamed-Moslemani/Recommendation-Systems.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Recommendation-Systems
   ```

3. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Notebooks and Scripts**

   Each directory contains scripts and notebooks specific to a recommendation type (e.g., movie or animation). Use Spark to load and preprocess data, and then train and test recommendation models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark for scalable data manipulation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Surprise, PySpark MLlib
