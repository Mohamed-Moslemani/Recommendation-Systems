## 🌠 Project Overview

This repository explores a variety of recommendation techniques, using methods that range from collaborative and content-based filtering to hybrid models. With scalable solutions built using Spark, this repo aims to tackle recommendation challenges across different domains, making it a versatile toolkit for recommendation system enthusiasts.

## 🔍 Key Components

Here’s a look at some of the components in this repository:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on user and item similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes the attributes of items to make recommendations.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for better accuracy.
- **Scalable Processing**: Uses Spark to manage large datasets efficiently.

## 📄 Directory Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder. Some of the current and potential contents include:

| Folder/Project              | Description                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `animation_recommendation/` | Recommendation system specifically for animations.                                 |
| `movie_recommendation/`     | A recommendation engine for movies, leveraging various filtering techniques.       |
| `.gitignore`                | Specifies files and folders to be ignored in the repository.                       |
| `requirements.txt`          | Lists all dependencies for the projects in this repository.                        |

More projects and recommendation systems will be added over time, so stay tuned!
